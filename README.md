# hyperPad-Project-Modder
A web application that allows users to import **hyperPad project files** `(.tap)` and apply crazy modifications, plugins and optimizations to help improve productivity and performance. This project is maintained by the community and is *not* endorsed by hyperPad developers.

This is currently a ```beta```, so some features may not work and some may not be implemented since this project is trivial and experimental.
