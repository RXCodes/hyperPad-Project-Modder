# hyperPad-Project-Modder
A web application that allows users to import **hyperPad project files** `(.tap)` and apply crazy modifications, plugins and optimizations to help improve productivity and performance. This project is maintained by the community and is *not* endorsed by hyperPad developers.

This is currently a ```beta```, so some features may not work and some may not be implemented since this project is trivial and experimental.

# Try It Out
You can test out the web application by clicking on the link provided below. Make sure you have a hyperPad project file `(.tap)` to test the app with! Please note that *.zip* files are **NOT** supported - the extension must be *.tap*!

# Functional Features
## Plugins
<img src='images/5316D60E-2EB3-47A3-BC1A-485ED2DD1352.jpeg' width=50%>
Users can create their own <code>plugin</code> by putting all the necessary behaviors in one object and then saving it to their account to use in other projects - that means you can <b style='color:#00bb78'>clone behaviors and assets</b> from one project to another! Users can share their plugins as a file and can also have the choice of making the plugin closed source to hide behaviors!

## Modify Objects
<img src='images/4103EF3A-AECC-4E13-A663-E867F4CA1284.jpeg' width=50%>
Select mutliple objects throughout your <b>entire</b> project using a search algorithm and modify their properties such as <code>object type</code>, <code>transformation</code> and much more! For example, you can change <code>Empty</code> Objects into <code>Graphic</code> Objects which was a highly requested feature! You can also delete multiple objects at once if you are trying to clear up some memory.

## Manipulate Behaviors
<img src='images/287AF35C-D225-4B58-9654-8B35BB242D3C.jpeg' width=50%>
You can <b>downgrade</b> behaviors so the project can work in earlier versions of hyperPad and you can <b>transfer</b> behaviors from one object to another. There is an option to <b>delete</b> behaviors in an object via the <code>Modify Objects</code> menu.

## Edit Scene Data
<img src='images/B47B39F0-86BE-47D4-B44A-14DE7FB44D8B.jpeg' width=50%>
Modify screen position, zoom, scene type <i>(that means you can change an overlay to a level and vice versa!)</i> and many other properties of a specified scene.

## View Project Data
<img src='images/B31F9CE2-1BF4-4256-AD56-0C7093345A55.jpeg' width=50%>
<b>See how many objects, behaviors and assets are present in the entire project.</b> For example, you can see how many of each behavior you've used! Don't worry about counting behaviors or keeping track of how many objects are in your scene - this app does that for you!

# Planned Features
## Assets Management
- **Compress all assets** to shrink overall project size - there will be compression options.
- See file sizes of all assets - user can decide to delete assets that take more storage.
